   We present a new construction of zero-knowledge argument. The prover time of our scheme is optimal: $O(C)$ for a circuit of size $C$, up to a constant multiplicative factor more than evaluating the circuit. When the circuit is log-space uniform with depth $d$, the proof size and verification time of our scheme is $d\log C$. 
   
   Underlying our new zero knowledge argument scheme is a new variant of the interactive proof protocol by Goldwasser et al. 2008 with linear prover time, and an efficient approach to turn the protocol to zero-knowledge using small masking polynomials.
   
   The implementation of our scheme, \name, shows that it only takes 200 seconds to generate a proof for constructing a Merkle tree with 511 SHA256 hashes, which is the best among all existing zero-knowledge proof systems. The proof size and the verification time of our scheme are also competitive.
