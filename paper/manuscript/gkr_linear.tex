\section{Linear Prover Time GKR Protocol}
In this section, we will present an implementation of GKR protocol\cite{GKR}, which is a improved version of CMT protocol\cite{CMT}. In this section we will improve the original CMT protocol and then propose slightly modified verion of improved CMT to make it zero knowledge.

\subsection{Roadmap}
Through out the whole CMT protocol, the prover has to answer two type of queries, one is the query related to sumcheck, another one is the query to combine the points. We will deal with these queries seperately. First we discuss the sumcheck. We are going to check the equation from Definition \ref{def::multilinear} for each sum check instances.
