\section{Zero Knowledge Argument Protocols}\label{sec:zkp}

In this section, we present the construction of our new zero-knowledge argument system. In~\cite{zhang2017vsql}, Zhang et al. proposed to combine the GKR protocol with a verifiable polynomial delegation protocol, resulting in an argument system. Later, in~\cite{zkvpd,hyrax}, the construction was extended to zero-knowledge, by sending all the messages in the GKR protocol in homomorphic commitments and performing all the checks by zero-knowledge equality and product testing. This incurs a high overhead for the verifier compared to the plain version without zero-knowledge, as each multiplication becomes an exponentiation and each equality check becomes a $\Sigma$-protocol, which is around $100\times$ slower in practice.

In this paper, we follow the same blueprint of combining GKR and VPD to obtain an argument system, but instead show how to extend it to be zero-knowledge efficiently. In particular, the prover masks the GKR protocol with special random polynomials so that the verifier runs a "randomized" GKR that leaks no extra information and her overhead is small. A similar approach was used by Chiesa et.al in~\cite{zksumcheck}. In the following, we present the zero-knowledge version of each building block, followed by the whole zero-knowledge argument.

\subsection{Zero Knowledge Sumcheck}\label{subsec:zksumcheck}
As a core step of the GKR protocol, $\P$ and $\V$ execute a sumcheck protocol on Equation~\ref{eq:GKR}, during which $\P$ sends $\V$ evaluations of the polynomial at several random points chosen by $\V$. These evaluations leak information about the values in the circuit, as they can be viewed as weighted sums of these values

To make the sumcheck protocol zero-knowledge, we take the approach proposed by Chiesa et al. in \cite{zksumcheck}, which is masking the polynomial in the sumcheck protocol by a random polynomial. In this approach, to prove 
$$H = \sum\nolimits_{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_\ell \in \binary}f(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_\ell)$$
, the prover generates a random polynomial $g$ with the same variables and individual degrees of $f$. She commits to the polynomial $g$, and sends the verifier a claim $G = \sum\limits_{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_\ell \in \binary}g(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_\ell)$. The verifier picks a random number $\rho$, and execute a sumcheck protocol with the prover on $$H + \rho G = \sum\nolimits_{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_\ell \in \{0, 1\}}(f(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_\ell) + \rho g(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_\ell)).$$ At the last round of this sumcheck, the prover opens the commitment of $g$ at $g(r_1, \ldots, r_\ell)$, and the verifier computes $f(r_1, \ldots, r_l)$ by subtracting $\rho g(r_1, \ldots, r_\ell)$ from the last message, and compares it with the oracle access of $f$. It is shown that as long as the commitment and opening of $f$ are zero-knowledge, the protocol is zero-knowledge. Intuitively, this is because all the coefficients of $f$ are masked by those of $g$. The soundness still holds because of the random linear combination of $f$ and $g$. 

Unfortunately, the masking polynomial $g$ is as big as $f$, and opening it to a random point later is expensive. In~\cite{zksumcheck}, the prover sends a PCP oracle of $g$, and executes a zero-knowledge sumcheck to open it to a random point, which incurs an exponential complexity for the prover. Even replacing it with the zkVPD protocol in~\cite{zkvpd}, the prover time is slow in practice.

In this paper, we show that it suffices to mask $f$ with a small polynomial to achieve zero-knowledge. In particular, we set $g(x_1, \ldots, x_\ell) = a_{0} + g_1(x_1) + g_2(x_2) + \ldots + g_\ell(x_\ell)$, where $g_{i}(x_i) = a_{i,1}x_i + a_{i,2}x_i^2 + \ldots + a_{i,d}x_i^d$ is a random univariate polynomial of degree $d$ ($d$ is the variable degree of $f$). Note here that the size of $g$ is only $O(d\ell)$, while the size of $f$ is $O(2^\ell)$.

The intuition of our improvement is that the prover sends $O(d\ell)$ messages in total to the verifier during the sumcheck protocol, thus a polynomial $g$ with $O(d\ell)$ random coefficients is sufficient to mask all the messages and achieve zero-knowledge. We present the full protocol in Construction~\ref{construction::zksumcheck}.

\label{construction::zksumcheck}
We assume the existence of a zkVPD protocol defined in Section~\ref{subsec::zkvpd}. For simplicity, we omit the randomness $r_f$ and public parameters $\pp,\vp$ without any ambiguity. To prove the claim $H = \sum\limits_{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_\ell \in \binary} f(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_\ell)$:
\begin{enumerate}

\item $\P$ selects a polynomial $g(x_1,\ldots, x_\ell) = a_{0} + g_1(x_1) + g_2(x_2) + \ldots + g_l(x_\ell)$, where $g_{i}(x_i) = a_{i,1}x_i + a_{i,2}x_i^2 + \ldots + a_{i,d}x_i^d$ and all $a_{i,j}$s are uniformly random. $\P$ sends $H = \sum\limits_{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_\ell \in \binary} f(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_\ell)$, $G = \sum\limits_{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_\ell \in \binary} g(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_\ell)$ and $\comm_g = \Commit(g)$ to $\V$.
\item $\V$ uniformly selects $\rho \in \mathbb{F}^*$, computes $H+\rho G$ and sends $\rho$ to $\P$.
\item $\P$ and $\V$ run the sumcheck protocol on
$$H + \rho G = \sum\limits_{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_\ell \in \binary}(f(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_\ell) + \rho g(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_\ell))$$
\item At the last round of the sumcheck protocol, $\V$ obtains a claim $h_\ell(r_\ell) = f(r_1, r_2, \ldots, r_\ell)+\rho g(r_1, r_2, \ldots, r_\ell)$. $\P$ and $\V$ opens the commitment of $g$ at $r = (r_1,\ldots, r_\ell)$ by $(g(r), \pi)\leftarrow\Open(g,r), \Verify(\comm_g,g(r),r,\pi)$. If $\Verify$ outputs $\reject$, $\V$ aborts.
\item $\V$ computes $h_\ell(r_\ell)-\rho g(r_1,\ldots,r_\ell)$ and compares it with the oracle access of $f(r_1,\ldots, r_\ell)$.

\end{enumerate}
\end{construction}}}}}
\vspace{-.2in}
\end{figure}
The completeness of the protocol holds obviously. The soundness follows the soundness of the sumcheck protocol and the random linear combination in step 2 and 3, as proven in~\cite{zksumcheck}. We give a proof of zero knowledge in Appendix~\ref{app:proofsc}.

\begin{theorem}[Zero knowledge]\label{thm:zksc}
	For every verifier $\V^*$ and every $\ell$-variate polynomial $f:\F^\ell\rightarrow\F$ with variable degree $d$, there exists a simulator $\S$ such that given access to $H = \sum\nolimits_{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_\ell \in \binary} f(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_\ell)$, $\S$ is able to simulate the partial view of $\V^*$ in step 1-4 of Construction~\ref{construction::zksumcheck}. 
\end{theorem}





\subsection{Zero knowledge GKR}\label{subsec::zkgkr}

To achieve zero-knowledge, we replace the sumcheck protocol in GKR with the zero-knowledge version described in the previous section. However, the protocol still leaks additional information. In particular, at the end of the zero-knowledge sumcheck, $\V$ queries the oracle to evaluate the polynomial on a random point. When executed on Equation~\ref{eq:GKR}, this reveals two evaluations of the polynomial $\tV_i$ defined by the values in the $i$-th layer of the circuit: $\tV_i(u)$ and $\tV_i(v)$.


To prevent this leakage, Chiesa et al.\cite{zksumcheck} proposed to replace the multi-linear extension $\tV_i$ with a low degree extension, such that learning $\tV_i(u)$ and $\tV_i(v)$ does not leak any information about $V_i$. Define a low degree extension of $V_i$ as 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:lde}
\dot{V}_{i}(z) \overset{def}{=} \tV_i(z)+Z_i(z)\sum\nolimits_{w \in \{0, 1\}^\lambda}R_i(z, w),
\end{equation}
where $Z(z) = \prod_{i=1}^{s_i} z_i(1-z_i)$, i.e., $Z(z)=0$ for all $z\in\{0, 1\}^{s_i}$. $R_i(z,w)$ is a random low-degree polynomial and $\lambda$ is the security parameter. With this low degree extension, Equation~\ref{eq:GKR} becomes

\begin{align}\label{eq:zkGKR}
\dot{V}_{i}(g)&=\sum\nolimits_{x, y\in \binary^{s_{i+1}}}\tilde{mult}_{i+1}(g, x, y)(\dot{V}_{i+1}(x)\dot{V}_{i+1}(y))\\
&+\tilde{add}_{i+1}(g,x,y)(\dot{V}_{i+1}(x)+\dot{V}_{i+1}(y))\nonumber + Z_i(g)\sum\nolimits_{w \in \binary^\lambda}R_i(g, w)\nonumber\\
&=\sum\nolimits_{x, y\in \binary^{s_{i+1}},w \in \binary^\lambda}(I(\vec{0},w) \cdot \tilde{mult}_{i+1}(g, x, y)(\dot{V}_{i+1}(x)\dot{V}_{i+1}(y))\\
&+\tilde{add}_{i+1}(g,x,y)(\dot{V}_{i+1}(x)+\dot{V}_{i+1}(y))\nonumber + I((x, y), \vec{0})Z_i(g)R_i(g, w))
\end{align}
where $I(\vec{a},\vec{b})$ is an identity polynomial $I(\vec{a},\vec{b}) = 0$ iff $\vec{a}=\vec{b}$. The first equation holds because $\dot{V}_i$ agrees with $\tV_i$ on the Boolean hyper-cube $\binary^{s_i}$, as $Z_i(z) = 0$ for binary inputs. The second equation holds because the mask in $\dot{V}_i$ is in the form of a "sum" and can be moved into the sumcheck equation. 

When executing the zero-knowledge sumcheck protocol on Equation~\ref{eq:zkGKR}, at the end of the protocol, $\V$ receives $\dot{V}_{i+1}(u)$ and $\dot{V}_{i+1}(v)$ for random points $u,v\in\F^{s_{i+1}}$ chosen by $\V$. They no longer leak information about $V_{i+1}$, as they are masked by $Z_{i+1}(z)\sum\nolimits_{w \in \{0, 1\}^\lambda}R_{i+1}(z, w)$ for $z=u$ and $z=v$. $\V$ computes $\tilde{mult}_{i+1}(g,u,v)$ and $\tilde{add}_{i+1}(g,u,v)$ as before, computes $Z_i(g), I(\vec{0},c), I((u,v),\vec{0})$ where $c\in\F^\lambda$ is a random point chosen by $\V$ for variable $w$, opens $R_i(g,w)$ at $c$  with $\P$ through a polynomial commitment, and checks that together with $\dot{V}_{i+1}(u), \dot{V}_{i+1}(v)$ received from $\P$ they are consistent with the last message of the sumcheck.$\V$ then uses $\dot{V}_{i+1}(u), \dot{V}_{i+1}(v)$ to proceed to the next round.

Unfortunately, similar to the zero-knowledge sumcheck, the masking polynomial $R_i$ is very large in~\cite{zksumcheck}. Opening $R_i$ at a random point takes exponential time for $\P$ either using a PCP oracle as in~\cite{zksumcheck} or potentially using a zkVPD, as $R$ has $s_i+2s_{i+1}+\lambda$ variables.

In this section, we show that we can set $R_i$ to be a small polynomial to achieve zero-knowledge. In particular, $R_i$ has only two variables with variable degree 2. This is because in the $(i-1)$-th round, $\V$ receives two evaluations of $V_i$, $\dot{V}_i(u)$ and $\dot{V}_i(v)$,  which are masked by $\sum_{w}R_i(u,w)$ and $\sum_{w}R_i(v,w)$; in the $i$-th sumcheck, $\V$ opens $R_i$ at $R_i(u,c)$ and $R_i(v,c)$. It suffices to make these four evaluations linearly independent, assuming the commitment and opening of $R_i$ are using a zkVPD. Therefore, we set the low-degree term in Equation~\ref{eq:lde} as $Z_i(z)\sum\nolimits_{w \in\binary} R_i(z_1, w)$, i.e. $R_i$ only takes two variables, the first variable $z_1$ of $z$ and an extra variable $w\in\binary$ instead of $\binary^\lambda$, with variable degree 2. 

The full protocol is presented in Construction~\ref{construction:zkgkr}. Here we use superscriptions (e.g., $u^{(i)}$) to denote random numbers or vectors for the $i$-th layer of the circuit.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:zkgkr}
	Construction~\ref{construction:zkgkr} is an interactive proof protocol per Definition~\ref{def:ip}, for a function $f$ defined by a layered arithmetic circuit $C$ such that $f(\mathsf{in},\mathsf{out}) = 1$ iff $C(\mathsf{in}) = \mathsf{out}$. In addition, for every verifier $\V^*$ and every layered circuit $C$, there exists a simulator $\S$ such that given oracle access to $\mathsf{out}$, $\S$ is able to simulate the partial view of $\V^*$ in step 1-5 of Construction~\ref{construction:zkgkr}. 
\end{theorem}

The completeness follows from the construction explained above and the completeness of the zero knowledge sumcheck. The soundness follows the soundness of the GKR protocol with low degree extensions, as proven in~\cite{GKR} and~\cite{zksumcheck}. We give the proof of zero knowledge in Appendix~\ref{app:proofgkr}.




\subsection{Zero knowledge VPD}\label{subsec::our_zkvpd}
In this section, we present the instantiations of the zkVPD protocol, as defined in Definition~\ref{def::zkvpd}. For every intermediate layer $i$, we use the same zkVPD protocol as proposed by Zhang et al. in~\cite{zkvpd} to commit and open the masking polynomials $g_i(x), R_i(z_1, w)$. In fact, as we show in the previous sections, these polynomials are very small ($g_i$ is the sum of univariate polynomials and $R_i$ has 2 variables with variable degree 2), the zkVPD protocols become very simple. The complexity of $\KeyGen, \Commit, \Open, \Verify$ and proof size are all $O(s_i)$ for $g_i$ and are all $O(1)$ for $R_i$. We omit the full protocols due to space limit.



For the zkVPD used for the input layer, we design a customized protocol based on the zkVPD protocol in~\cite{zkvpd}. Recall that at the end of the GKR protocol, $\V$ receives two evaluations of the polynomial $\dot{V}_d(z)=\tV_d(z)+Z_d(z)\sum\nolimits_{w \in\binary} R_d(z_1,w)$ at $z=u^{(d)}$ and $z=v^{(d)}$. In our zero knowledge proof protocol, which will be presented in Section~\ref{subsec::zkall}, $\P$ commits to $\dot{V}_d(z)$ using the zkVPD at the beginning, and opens it to the two points selected by $\V$.

The protocol in~\cite{zkvpd} works for any polynomial with $\ell$ variables and any variable degree, and is particularly efficient for multilinear polynomials. We modify the protocol for our zero-knowledge proof scheme and preserves the efficiency. Note that though $\dot{V}_d(z)$ is a low degree extension of the input, it can be decomposed to the sum of $\tV_d(z)$, a multilinear polynomial, and $Z_d(z)\sum\nolimits_{w \in\binary} R_d(z_1,w)$. Moreover, $Z_d(u^{(d)})$ and $Z_d(v^{(d)})$ can be computed directly by $\V$. Therefore, in our construction, $\P$ commits to $\tV_d(z)$ and $\sum\nolimits_{w \in\binary} R_d(z_1,w)$ separately, and later opens the sum together given $Z_d(u^{(d)})$ and $Z_d(v^{(d)})$, which is naturally supported because of the homomorphic property of the commitment. Another optimization is that unlike other layers of the circuit, $R_d(z_1,w)$ itself is not opened at two points ($\V$ does not receive $R_d(u^{(d)},c^{(d)})$ and $R_d(v^{(d)},c^{(d)})$ in Construction~\ref{construction:zkgkr}). Therefore, it suffices to set $\dot{V}_d(z)=\tV_d(z)+Z_d(z)R_d(z_1)$, where $R_d$ is a univariate linear polynomial. The full protocol is presented in Appendix~\ref{app:zkvpdconstruction}.




\begin{theorem}\label{thm:zkvpd}
	Construction~\ref{construction::zkVPD} is a zero-knowledge verifiable polynomial delegation scheme as defined by Definition~\ref{def::zkvpd}, under Assumption~\ref{asp::qSDH} and~\ref{asp::dlEPKE}.
\end{theorem}

The proof of completeness, soundness and zero knowledge is similar to that of the zkVPD protocol in~\cite{zkvpd}. We only add an extra univariate linear polynomial $R(x_1)$, which does not affect the proof. We omit the proof due to space limit. Using the same algorithms proposed in in~\cite{vram,zkvpd}, the running time of $\KeyGen$, $\Commit$ and $\Open$ is $O(2^\ell)$, $\Verify$ takes $O(\ell)$ time and the proof size is $O(\ell)$.







\subsection{Putting Everything Together}\label{subsec::zkall}

In this section, we present our zero knowledge argument scheme. At a high level, similar to~\cite{zhang2017vsql,hyrax,zkvpd}, $\V$ can use the GKR protocol to verify the correct evaluation of a circuit $C$ on input $x$ and a witness $w$, given an oracle access to the evaluation of a polynomial defined by $x,w$ on a random point. We instantiate the oracle using the zkVPD protocol. Formally, we present the construction in Construction~\ref{construction::all}, which combines our zero knowledge GKR and zkVPD protocols. Similar to the protocols in~\cite{zkvpd,hyrax}, Step 6 and 7 are to check that $\P$ indeed uses $x$ as the input to the circuit.

\begin{theorem}\label{theorem:main}
	For an input size $n$ and a finite field $\F$, Construction~\ref{construction::all} is a zero knowledge argument for the relation
	\[
	\mathcal{R} = \{(C,x;w): C\in\mathcal{C}_\F\wedge|x|+|w|\le n\wedge C(x;w) = 1\},
	\]
	as defined in Definition~\ref{def::zkp}, under Assumption~\ref{asp::qSDH} and~\ref{asp::dlEPKE}. Moreover, for every $(C,x;w)\in\mathcal{R}$, the running time of $\P$ is $O(|C|)$ field operations and $O(n)$ multiplications in the base group of the bilinear map. The running time of $\V$ is $O(|x|+d\cdot\log |C|)$ if $C$ is log-space uniform with $d$ layers. $\P$ and $\V$ interact $O(d\log |C|)$ rounds and the total communication (proof size) is $O(d\log |C|)$. In case $d$ is $\mathsf{polylog}(|C|)$, the protocol is a succinct argument.
\end{theorem}

\paragraph{Proof Sketch.} The correctness and the soundness follow from those of the two building blocks, zero knowledge GKR and zkVPD, by Theorem~\ref{thm:zkgkr} and~\ref{thm:zkvpd}.

To prove zero knowledge, consider a simulator $\S$ that calls the simulator $\S_{GKR}$ of zero knowledge GKR given in Section~\ref{subsec::zkgkr} as a subroutine, which simulates the partial view up to the input layer. At the input layer, the major challenge is that $\S$ committed to (a randomly chosen) $\dot{V}^*_d$ at the beginning of the protocol, before knowing the points $u^{(d)}, v^{(d)}$ to evaluate on. If $\S$ opens the commitment honestly, with high probability the evaluations are not consistent with the last message of the GKR (sumcheck in layer $d-1$) and a malicious $\V^*$ can distinguish the ideal world from the real world. In our proof, we resolve this issue by using the simulator $\S_{VPD}$ of our zkVPD protocol. Given the trapdoor $\mathsf{trap}$ used in $\KeyGen$, $\S_{VPD}$ is able to open the commitment to any value in zero knowledge, and in particular it opens to those messages that are consistent with the GKR protocol in our scheme, which completes the construction of $\S$. We defer the formal proof to the full version of the paper. 

The complexity of our zero knowledge argument scheme follows from our new GKR protocol with linear prover time, and the complexity of the zkVPD protocol for the input layer analyzed in Section~\ref{subsec::our_zkvpd}. The masking polynomials $g_i, R_i$ and their commitments and openings introduce no asymptotic overhead and are efficient in practice.
