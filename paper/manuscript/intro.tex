\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

\paragraph{Our contributions.} In this paper, we propose a new zero-knowledge proof scheme. Our scheme is based on the doubly efficient interactive proof proposed by Goldwasser et al. in~\cite{GKR} (referred as \emph{GKR} protocol in this paper), and the verifiable polynomial delegation scheme proposed by Zhang et al. in~\cite{zhang2017vsql}. Our main contributions are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{GKR with linear prover time.} We develop a new algorithm to generate the proof in the GKR protocol for arbitrary layered arithmetic circuit in linear time. Our prover time is asymptotically the same as evaluating the circuit and is optimal. Our algorithm does not require any pattern in the circuit and this result subsumes all existing improvements on the GKR prover assuming special circuit structures, such as regular circuits in~\cite{t13}, data parallel circuits in~\cite{t13,wahby2017full}, circuits with different sub-copies in~\cite{vram}. See related work for more details. 
	\item \textbf{Efficient ZKP protocol.}
	\item Implementation
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Comparing to other ZKP systems.}
