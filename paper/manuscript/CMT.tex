\subsection{CMT Protocol}
CMT Protocol (Cormode et al.)\cite{CMT} is based on the work of Goldwasser et al. \cite{GKR}, gives us a efficient implementation of GKR protocol. We will futhur improve CMT protocol to optimal prover time and make it zero knowledge without any assumption on the circuit. In this section, we will introduce the original CMT protocol here.

Assume $C$ is a \textit{layered arithmetic circuit} with depth $d$ over a finite field $\mathbb{F}$. The gates in $i$-th layer takes input from $i+1$-th layer and outputs to $i-1$-th layer; layer $0$ is the output layer, and layer $d$ is the input layer. 

The protocol proceeds layer by layer. The prover starts by sending the output value to the verifier. Then the protocol starts from the output layer. In $i$-th round the verifier.
